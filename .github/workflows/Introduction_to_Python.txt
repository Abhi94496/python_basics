1. Introduction to Python

### What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

### Features of Python
- **Simple and Easy to Learn**: Pythonâ€™s syntax is straightforward, making it an excellent choice for beginners.
- **Interpreted Language**: Python executes code line by line, which simplifies debugging.
- **Versatile**: Python supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Python comes with a vast standard library and has third-party libraries for specialized tasks.
- **Cross-Platform**: Python works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.

### Installing Python
Follow these steps to install Python on your system:
1. Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org).
2. Download the latest version for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and ensure you check the box to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing `python --version`.

### Running Python Programs
Python programs can be run in two primary ways:
1. **Interactive Mode (Python Shell):**
   - Open the terminal/command prompt.
   - Type `python` or `python3` to start the Python interactive shell.
   - You can type Python commands and see immediate results.
   - Example:
     ```
     >>> print("Hello, World!")
     Hello, World!
     ```

2. **Script Mode (Using a File):**
   - Create a new file with the `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`).
   - Write your Python code in the file:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```
   - Save the file and run it from the terminal/command prompt using:
     ```
     python hello.py
     ```

### Why Learn Python?
- Python is beginner-friendly and widely used in various industries, including web development, data science, and automation.
- It has a strong community and extensive resources for learning and troubleshooting.
- Python skills are highly valued in the job market, making it a great language for career development.

### Fun Fact
The name "Python" was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, not the snake. This is why Python documentation often uses playful examples!
